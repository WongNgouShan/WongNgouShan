- 😄 Pronouns: In linguistics and grammar, a pronoun (abbreviated pro) is a word that substitutes for a noun or noun phrase.
Pronouns have traditionally been regarded as one of the parts of speech, but some modern theorists would not consider them to form a single class, in view of the variety of functions they perform cross-linguistically. (From wikipedia:[url](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pronoun))
