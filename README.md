Hongkonger/undergraduate from CUHK

I like coding but I also like artistic stuff like drawing(mainly anime girls) and making videos!
I had my first try of making a website on both front-end and back-end recently. Check out [Our-first-website](https://github.com/WongNgouShan/Our-1st-website)

I am currently working on: 
- Improving my website. Check out [My-Personal-Website](https://github.com/WongNgouShan/My-Personal-Website)
- [Another group project on getting use of some web API.](https://github.com/achan211/CSCI2720/tree/main)

Other coding related work I want to do in the future:
- Making a game
